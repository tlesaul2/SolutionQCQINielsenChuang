Eve makes her qubits entangled with $\ket{\beta_{00}}$, and gets $\rho^E$.
\begin{align}
\ket{ABE} = U\ket{\beta_{00}^{\otimes n}}\ket{0}_E\\
\rho^E = tr_{AB} (\ket{ABE} \bra{ABE})
\end{align}
Note that Eve's mutual information with Alice and Bob measurements does not depend on whether Eve measures $\rho^E$ before Alice and Bob's measurement or after.
So we can assume that Eve measures $\rho^E$ after Alice and Bob's measurement.
Alice and Bob measure their Bell state, getting binary string $\vec{k}$ as an outcome.
Let $\rho^E_k$ and $p_k$ are the corresponding Eve's states and probabilities.
Note,
\begin{align}
\rho_E = \sum_k p_k \rho^E_k.
\end{align}
Let $K$ is a variable of $\vec{k}$ and $e$ is an outcom of a measurement of $\rho^E$, and $E$ is its variable.  From Holevo bound, 
\begin{align}
H(K:E) \le S(\rho^E) - \sum_k p_k \rho^E_k \le S(\rho^E) = S(\rho).
\end{align}
